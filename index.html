          <h2>Bio:</h2>
          <p>Born in a small-town in North Dakota. Raised by THE BEST single, working-class mother in Minnesota. Molded into a well-rounded young man at Breck School -- Won a state championship in football and elected captain of the football team. Educated at Middlebury College -- Majored in Philosophy and Political Science. Elected President of the Student Government Association, and Student Co-Chair of the Budget Oversight Committee and Community Council. Served as President of Voices of Indigenous People. Founded the Social Justice Alliance. Studied Policy and Law at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley. Forced to graduate and find a real job. Got a taste of politics interning for Congressman Mike Honda in Washington DC. Got a taste of Big Government a the Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Minority Health. Became disillusioned with Capitol Hill -- Sought alternative methods for social change and community development. Fostered greater diversity, inclusion, and cultural competency in the public and private sectors at the consulting firm Cook Ross Inc. Refined my leadership skills at the Management Center, and the New Leader's Fellowship at the Center for American Progress. Utilized my refined leadership skills to develop and head an internship program at Cook Ross Inc. Wanted to do more -- devised and launched a successful fund-raising campaign which built a library and computer lab at New Dawn Education Center in the Kibera slum in Nairobi Kenya. Met some cool kids and danced to lots of East African music. Turned an interest in Photography into a full-blown passion at the Washington School of Photography (WSP) and School for Visual Arts (SVA). Turned in a comfortable desk job for that starving-artist life in New York City. Hustled...hard. Learned from industry leading photographers. Started shooting video -- Filmed a promo video campaign for Dialogue Direct -- Loved it. Selected as 1 of 11 inaugral fellows out of over 400 applicants to diversify the tech industry as a full-stack developer -- Loved it. Built websites, web applications, and software for the Sunlight Foundation, NGP VAN, and space150. Found a career that fullfills me. </p>
          <p>I love my path in life. Each bump and bend in the road has shaped me, and as a result I wake up each day to mold and be molded by the exciting, the unique, and the profound.</p>
